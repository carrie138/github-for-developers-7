#Bio

My name is Carrie Barlowe. I am a graduate student studying Bioinformatics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, but I live an hour and a half away in Marion, NC. I like to eat chocolate, drink Mountain Dew, play dumb Android games, and start self-paced learning courses that I rarely finish. My favorite color is red.
